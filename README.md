# TheAiHigh-School of Innovation

My name is Anand, I am the father of two high-schoolers at American High. I am also a semiconductor industry veteran and been deep into AI since 2015 when it was just being reborn. The AI education online or otherwise, generally fails to teach the practical aspects of AI that are commonly encountered in real life. They do great job of explaining the mathematics, or coding. However, the 'real-life' aspects - such as understanding how challenging the data pipeline could be, or dealing with different file formats or what it takes to build a user friendly app - don't get as much attention. It is also hard to find explanation of AI in English in these classes that limits the understanding of neural networks. The goal of these classes is to enable students with the knowledge that is not covered elsewhere. These boot camps are in general complementary to what is available out there. Students can still take AI course from say Harvard or Stanford for AI, and use the knowledgese learned here. The goal is to enable students to use their imagination and use AI to solve real life applications. We plan to use industry standard resouces such as HuggingFace, Google Colab and Github for them. We'll use AI to write code. The goal is to enable students to enhance critical thinking to build AI applications, just as they would do when they join workforce. 

General Philosophy: 

In these classes, you'll learn to create and use artificial intelligence, with a focus on mathematics, intelligence, neural networks, data, models, app pipelines, and real-world applications. We’ll dive into topics not covered in other AI courses, such as translation of linear algebra into geometric interpretation and relationship to intelligence, the importance of data preparation, and the challenges of putting AI into production. We’ll use industry standard state-of-the-art tools like GitHub, Colab, and HuggingFace, so students will be step ahead of the others. Where possible, we'll also use Vibe coding to simplify overall coding and project building.

Boot Camps :

Each coot camp will be day long and held on wekends.Students can pursue optional project after the class. The goal of these projects is to build a publishable project that can help students get admission into good colleges.
•	Sunday Boot Camp: Students will engage in theory and code with a low-code approach, tackle real-life problem-solving projects. Each boot camp will get deeper and deeper into 
•	Optional project: Students will come up with their idea for project and form a team. The expectation is that students keep contributing to these and improve the results with each course. A team of experts will guide them through the process.

Boot Camp1: Understanding language models and building apps

Boot Camp2: Using Vibe coding to build complete language apps

Boot Camp3: Advanced topics in language model based applications


Schedule:

Bootcamp 1 - Understanding and building language model applications
Feb 28, 9 AM – 3 PM

Bootcamp 2 – Using Vibe coding to build advanced language model applications
March 5 , 9 AM – 3 PM

Bootcamp 3 – Advanced topics in language models and applications
March 12, 9 AM – 3 PM

All classes will be held at:
6335 Jarvis Ave, Newark, CA 94560, United States
Fees: $200/bootcamp

Zelle to 408 623 9164

Optional Project:

Students must form a team and come up with an idea (we will support the ideation and feasibility)

Up to 4 students in a team who focus on different aspects of application building

The team will be paired with an AI expert.

Students should set up a weekly meeting and present updates on Sunday to the instructor and the rest of the teams

The project will renew each class and students will continue to improve till it's publication/Github ready

Cost: $1000/student
