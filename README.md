# TheAiHigh-School of Innovation

My name is Anand, I am the father of two high-schoolers at American High. I am also a semiconductor market veteran and been deep into AI since 2015 when it was just being reborn. Tge AI education online or otherwise, generally fails to teach the practical aspects of AI that are commonly encountered in real life. They do great job of explaining the mathematics, or coding. However, the 'real-life' aspects - such as understanding how challenging the data pipeline could be, or dealing with different file formats or what it takes to build a user friendly app - don't get as much attention. These aspects are the ones stalling projects in the industry, and the goal of these classes is to enable students with that knowledge. These classes are in general complementary to what is available out there. Students can still take AI course from say Harvard or Stanford for AI, and use the knowledgese. The goal is to enable students to use their imagination and use AI to solve real life applications. We plan to use industry standard resouces such as HuggingFace, Google Colab and Github for them. We'll use AI to write code. The goal is to enable students to enhance critical thinking to build AI applications, just as they would do when they join workforce. 

General Philosophy: 

These classes are designed for students passionate about AI. You'll learn to create and use artificial intelligence, with a focus on mathematics, intelligence, neural networks, data, models, app pipelines, and real-world applications. We’ll dive into topics not covered in other AI courses, such as translation of linear algebra into geometric interpretation and relationship to intelligence, the importance of data preparation, and the challenges of putting AI into production. We’ll use industry standard state-of-the-art tools like GitHub, Colab, and HuggingFace, so students will be step ahead of the others.

Course Plan:

Each course will have a Saturday boot camp, and optional project for rest of three weeks. These courses will run throughout the year, each one building on top of other.
•	Saturday Boot Camp: Students will engage in theory and coding with a low-code approach, tackle real-life problem-solving projects, and work on publication-ready projects supervised by AI experts.
•	Monthly project: Students will come up with their idea for project and form a team. The expectation is that students keep contributing to these and improve the results with each course. A team of experts will guide them through the process.

Expectations: 

This program is for serious and committed students with a passion for AI, ideas on how to use or build AI, and ambitions to leverage AI for college admissions or projects like YCombinator.

Guest Speakers: 

Learn from the best! Each course features an expert guest speaker from the industry, such as Meta's HR Director, Genentech's VP of Data Science, and Amazon's Director. Stay connected with these industry leaders for learning and opportunities.
